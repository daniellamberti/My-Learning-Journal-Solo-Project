        <p class="summary-title">How I stay commited to learning</p>
        <p class="description2">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours
            learning,
            then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques
            into existing projects.
        <p class="description2">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and
            most
            things about my journey with the world.</p>

        <p class="summary-title">How I got started</p>
        <p class="description2"> I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
            I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my
            notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I
            learned using my own words.
        <p class="description2">That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that
            posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
